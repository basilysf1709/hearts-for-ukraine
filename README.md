# Inspiration
While researching for the project, we realized that most of the news about the crisis reports the number of people lost which is less impactful and it is also not helpful to the people who want information about their loved ones. By building a website to host the memoirs for the fallen, we aim to attach names and faces to the numbers and statistics to the fallen so that people can search and view the massive loss of life in the war.

# What it does
The idea that we came up with is a website to honor all the people that have passed away from the Ukraine-Russia crisis. The website also allows people to send in information about loved ones to be shared and remembered by people. The website also serves as a reminder to the people all around the world of the personal cost of wars.

# How we built it
Used ReactJS to build the frontend and designed the backend to use graphQL

# Challenges we ran into
Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Used a user- based design process to come up with the idea and specify requirements
2. Used UX/UI design principles to make a reasonably responsive website within 10 hours

# What we learned
1. Design
2. Practicing empathy and using that to make a user focussed design
3. Understanding the conflict and how it affects the people in a personal sense
4. Technical skills
5. Learned to implement React Hooks to change the state of components
6. How to deploy a website
7. Testing a website and how to make it responsive

# What's next for HeartsOfUkraine.
1. Create a CMS system that connects the front-end and back-end of the website for data modification.
2. Create database to hold all data collected from the website.
3. Automate data validation and update process
4. Search feature to find people
5. Resources tab

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
